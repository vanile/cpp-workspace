 * Professor: Edwin Rodr&iacute;guez
 *
 * Programming Assignment: Class Project
 *
 * In this assignment, our team created a two dimensional grid game. 
 * The grid is 9 by 9 with 9 rooms equally distributed throughout the grid with one of them having the briefcase. 
 * That briefcase is the goal that the spy (the player) is trying to capture. 
 * The player must traverse through the grid while avoiding enemies. 
 * The player can only see two spaces in front of him and cannot tell if the room has the briefcase without checking the room. 
 * The player is also aided by power-ups. 
 * Once the player finds the briefcase they win. 
 * However, if they die three times, they lose.
