<h1>Interests</h1>
<h2>Research<br>
</h2>
<p>My general interests usually fall in the theoretical ground:
Artificial Intelligence, Computability Theory, Computational Complexity,
Programming Languages and Software Analysis (Abstraction, Correctness
Verification, etc.). If only I could do all these stuff, I'd be VERY
happy. But I can't. So, my work focuses
mainly in the first and last areas I mentioned:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Software analysis:</span> My work in this area has centered around the
development of specification languages, and verification of correctness properties on multi-threaded software,
as well as secure information flow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Artificial Intelligence:</span> My work in AI
has focused in <a href="http://www.aip.de/~ast/EvolCompFAQ/top.htm">Genetic
and Evolutionary Computation (GEC)</a> and <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume4/kaelbling96a-html/rl-survey.html">Reinforcement
Learning</a>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<!--<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>In my spare time (?) there are a bunch of things I like to do:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Family time:</span> I like to
spend time with my family, you know, go out or just gather in the living
room to laugh about Verónica's last occurrence. Also, I love
spending time just playing with my daughter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exercise:</span> I like playing
sports, particularly basketball.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading:</span> I love reading. I
can read just about anything and with this hobby I have a problem,
because usually when I'm reading a book I really like, I just can't stop
reading and tends to interefere with my every day tasks. I read
magazines, research papers (not counting those related with my work),
articles... I just love it. And I love books. Books are like a sacred
thing to me. Don't mess with my books! Right now I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0486689069/qid=1113838278/sr=8-8/ref=pd_ka_1/103-5719022-5286252?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">
 Fundamentals of Number Theory</a> by
 William J. LeVeque.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Movies:</span> I enjoy a lot
watching movies. I go to the theater whenever I get a chance, but
usually either just rent some DVD's or watch TV.</li>
</ul>-->

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2>Cool Quotes by Computer Scientists</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>The only way tcsh "rocks" is when the rocks are attached to it's feet in the
deepest part of a very deep lake.</i> - Linus Torvalds
<br><br></li>
<li><i>When you say "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people just stare at
you blankly and say "Hey, I got those with the system, *for free*".</i> - Linus Torvalds
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Dijkstra probably hates me.</i> - Linus Torvalds
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Many computer scientists have fallen into the trap of trying to define languages like
George Orwell's Newspeak, in which it is impossible to think bad thoughts.
What they end up doing is killing the creativity of programming.</i> - Larry Wall
<br><br></li>
<li><i>I dunno, I dream in Perl sometimes...</i> - Larry Wall
<br><br></li>
<li><i>In general, if you think something isn't in Perl, try it out, because it usually is.</i>
- Larry Wall
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.</i> - Alan Turing
<br><br></li>
<li><i>There are two ways of constructing a software design;
one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies,
and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
The first method is far more difficult.</i> - Charles Anthony Richard Hoare
<br><br></li>
<li><i>... the psychological profiling [of a programmer] is mostly the ability to shift levels
of abstraction, from low level to high level.
To see something in the small and to see something in the large.</i> - Donald E. Knuth
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it</i>
- Donald E. Knuth
<br><br></li>
<li><i>I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty,
you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself:
'Dijkstra would not have liked this',
well that would be enough immortality for me.</i> - Edsger Dijkstra
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</i>
- Edsger Dijkstra
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!</i>
- Edsger Dijkstra
<br><br></li>
<li><i>It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC:
as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.</i>
- Edsger Dijkstra
<br><br></li>
<li><i>UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.</i>
- Dennis Ritchie
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</i> - Robert W Floyd (also attributed 
Donald E. Knuth and C.A.R. Hoare)
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.</i>
- Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
<br></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cool Quotes by non Computer Scientists</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand
it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.</i>
- Albert Einstein
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.</i>
- Thomas Alva Edison
<br><br></li>

- Mahatma Ghandi
<br><br></li>

<br><br></li>
<li><i>I never met a man so stupid I could not learn something from him.</i>
- Galileo Galilei

<li><i>I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason,
and intellect has intended us to forego their use.</i>
- Galileo Galilei
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Let the one who is free of sin step forward and throw the first stone.</i>
- Jesus of Nazareth
<br><br></li>

and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.</i>
- Jesus of Nazareth
<br><br></li>
<li><i>Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it,
no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.</i>
